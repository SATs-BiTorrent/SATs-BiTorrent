# SATs (BitTorrent) Token

## What is the SATs (BitTorrent) Token?

The SATs (BitTorrent) token is a creatorâ€™s token within the BitTorrent ecosystem. It is designed to enhance the utility and value of the BitTorrent (BTT) platform by engaging and rewarding users.

## Key Features and Functions

### Reward System

- **Participation Rewards**: SATs tokens reward users for their participation and engagement in various activities within the BitTorrent ecosystem.
- **Earning SATs**: Users can earn SATs tokens by staking wrapped BitTorrent Tokens (WBTT).

### Staking Mechanism

- **Daily Rewards**: Daily rewards are distributed to users who stake WBTT.
  - Example: If 100,000 SATs are distributed daily, and you stake 1,000 WBTT in a pool with 10 other stakers each staking 1,000 WBTT, the rewards will be split evenly (10% each).
  - Larger Stakes: If a user stakes a larger amount, such as 1,000,000 WBTT, they will receive a larger share (90%) of the rewards.

### Ownership and Unstaking

- **User Ownership**: Staked WBTT remains the property of the user.
- **No Penalties**: Users can choose to unstake their WBTT at any time without incurring charges, reflecting the community-focused nature of the project.

### NFT Staking

- **Additional Rewards**: There is an additional option for NFT staking, which offers more daily rewards.
- **Fair Distribution**: This mechanism is designed to control greed and ensure fair distribution among users.

## How It Works

### Earning SATs

- **Engagement**: Users earn SATs by participating in social engagement and group activities within the BitTorrent ecosystem.
- **dApp Providers**: dApp providers can also earn SATs through similar engagement and participation.

### Staking Rewards

- **Staking**: Users stake their WBTT in a pool.
- **Daily Distribution**: Daily rewards in the form of SATs are distributed based on the amount of WBTT staked.
  - **Higher Stakes, Higher Rewards**: The more WBTT a user stakes, the higher their share of the daily rewards.

### Unstaking and Community Focus

- **Retaining Ownership**: Users can unstake their WBTT at any time, retaining ownership without penalties.
- **Community-Driven Rewards**: The project emphasizes community-driven rewards, allowing users to reward each other without needing to set a market value price.

The SATs (BitTorrent) token aims to create a more engaging and rewarding environment for users within the BitTorrent ecosystem, promoting participation and the growth of the community.
